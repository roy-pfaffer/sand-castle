#Sand Castle
Sand Castle is a simple, collaborative brainstorming/wireframing tool
for building simple front-end code.  The application uses web sockets to
allow users to edit and update code in real time: users can see other
users type code as they type it, and they can see changes in the code
made as other users submit their code.  The application also includes a
simple chat feature that allows users to communicate while they
collaborate.

Check out the GitHub page
[here](https://github.com/roy-pfaffer/sand-castle).  Or, you can
check out the project on Heroku
[here](http://sand-castle.herokuapp.com).

###Create and Maintain Projects
Start a new project by changing the path of the URL
(http://sand-castle.herokuapp.com/[some_project_name]). If the project
name hasn't already been taken, Sand Castle will create a new project
for you. If it has, it'll load whatever project was there before, with
its most recent changes.

###Edit Code
Move your mouse cursor near the bottom of the window and three edit
fields for HTML, CSS, and Javascript will appear. Edit these fields to
change the code of your project. Press [shift]-[enter] to submit and
save code (and see the changes made in real time).

###Collaborate with Others
Collaborate with friends by visiting the same URL path. Changes to the
edit fields can be seen in real time. Code changes submitted with
[shift]-[enter] will be immediately seen by anyone else also viewing the
same project.

###Communicate
Chat with our Sand Castle users by clicking on the project and pressing
[enter]. Type your message and press [enter] again to send. You can also
change your alias by pressing '/' instead of [enter]. Type 'alias
[some_name] to change your name.
